How to Download the Correct Version
To install this mod properly:
- Do not use the green “Code → Download ZIP” button — it downloads the entire source code, not the installable version.

- Download the file named KerbCalcProjekt.zip (or similar).
- Extract the ZIP and place the KerbCalcProjekt/ folder directly into your GameData/ directory.
 That’s it — you’re ready to launch!
